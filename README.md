# Personal Portfolio & Blog | Harrison Daniel Chinomso

Hello, welcome to my personal portfolio and integrated blog project.  
This is more than just a static website, it’s a **digital canvas** where I showcase my work in **software engineering**, while also exploring my passions in **history, psychology, and emerging technologies like blockchain**.  

The goal of this project is twofold:  
1. To serve as a professional **portfolio** that highlights my career as a software engineer.  
2. To act as a **thought space** where I explore ideas at the intersection of technology, history, and psychology (fields I intend to pursue further in my academic journey).

## Project Overview

This website is structured into **core pages** for professional visibility, alongside a **blog ecosystem** that houses carefully written articles. The posts reflect my interdisciplinary interests:  
- **Tech:** software engineering, AI, blockchain, and future trends.  
- **History:** lessons from the past that shape innovation today.  
- **Psychology:** the human element in technology and decision-making.  

Together, these pages demonstrate not only technical skill in **frontend development (HTML, CSS, responsive design and javascript)** but also **depth of thought** in how I approach complex, cross-disciplinary questions.

## Closing Note

This is not just a portfolio, it’s a story about how technology, history, and psychology intertwine in
shaping innovation and the human experience. I built this project not just to showcase skills, but to
share a vision: that the past, present, and future all inform each other, and that technology built with
empathy and insight will always stand the test of time.
